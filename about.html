    <p>
      Fitness Toolkit is a free, beginner-friendly platform created by Ketan Kurve to help people
      track their BMI, understand their calorie needs, and discover easy vegan meal suggestions.

      The idea behind Fitness Toolkit is simple: bring health and simplicity together. Whether you're just starting your fitness journey or trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle, this tool gives you the data and motivation you need â€” all in one place.

      This toolkit was built with clean design, privacy in mind, and 100% ad-free user experience during development. We now aim to support hosting and improvements through AdSense.
